/**
 * This is part of an implementation of the main algorithm of [1]. It generates an deterministic, 
 * incremental, well-dispersed sequence of rotations, represented in Hopf coordinates.
 * 
 * 
 * This header file declares two relevant functions from a previous HEALPix version (circa ~2008).
 * 
 * NOTES: 
 *  (1) The original code herein was taken from Jain (2009). I merely placed them in the same 
 *      source file and removed code that was commented out.
 *  (2) [1] cites Jain (2009) as a reference to the source code. It is no longer available online. 
 *      My C code is derived from the Authors' C++ code. Their original C++ code is available at
 *          https://mitchell-web.ornl.gov/SOI/index.php
 *      under "ISOI_SO3_sequence.tgz".
