# Small Rotation Toolbox

This repo is a MATLAB implementation of several functions relating to 3d rotations. These include:

- Uniformly and quasi-uniformly sampling rotations (***sampling***)
- Converting between several representations of rotations (***conversion***)
- Applying a rotation to 3d vectors (***utility/applyRotation.m***)
- Measuring distance between rotations (***utility/rotationDistance.m***)

Part of the code is written in C.
